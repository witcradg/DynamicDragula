# DynamicDragula
This is a Meteor example using Dragula for drag and drop between dynamically created containers. 

I created this project to 
  - to show an issue I was having with Dragula. 
  - to use as a sandbox for trying various things with Dragula
  - to present Dragula sample code that I did not find online with the hope someone will find it useful 

The issue:
  ~~Code that works with a mouse does not work with touchscreen devices.~~ 
  [It turned out this was as simple as the setTimeout aroundthe dragula call]
  
Caveat:
This code is hacked from a real world project that is still under development. As such there is work here that is neither complete nor optimized, especially with regard to the bootstrap columns. Any suggestions would be welcome even if not directly related to the Dragula issue.
